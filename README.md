# ZED One Theme for VS Code

A faithful recreation of Zed's beloved One theme for Visual Studio Code. Because sometimes you need VS Code's extensions, but you refuse to compromise on style.

## ✨ Features

- **🌙 Dark Mode**: Rich, warm colors that won't burn your retinas during those late-night coding sessions
- **☀️ Light Mode**: Clean, crisp aesthetics for the daylight warriors
- **🎨 Complete Coverage**: Meticulously crafted syntax highlighting for all your favorite languages
- **🖥️ Terminal Colors**: Full ANSI color support that matches the editor theme
- **🔧 Semantic Highlighting**: Enhanced code understanding with VS Code's semantic token support

## 🚀 Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "ZED One Theme"
4. Click Install
5. Go to Preferences > Color Theme and select either:
   - **ZED One Theme Dark**

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

This isn't just another port. We've carefully analyzed Zed's original One theme and recreated:

- **Syntax Colors**: Every token type matches Zed's original color palette
- **UI Elements**: Activity bar, sidebars, tabs, and panels all mirror Zed's aesthetic
- **Terminal Integration**: Full 16-color ANSI palette that harmonizes with the theme
- **Editor Features**: Proper highlighting for selections, find matches, and indentation guides
